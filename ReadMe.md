# Microsoft.DirectX.Linux.Binaries

Official binaries of Microsoft DirectX for Linux extracted from Windows
Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2).

## Note

Some people ask me why contains 10.0.20277.1 version's binary.

Because this is the last version for Windows Iron branch which have both arm64
and x64 version. Also, I had calculated the SHA-256 between related x64 files 
from 20277.1 and 20348.169 (a.k.a Windows Server 2022 RTM ISO) and results are 
the same.
